//! Fake commands for the tests to exec, written so a fork cannot make that exec
//! fail ETXTBSY.
//!
//! A child forked by any thread holds a copy of every fd its parent had open
//! until it execs, and the kernel refuses to exec a file that has a writer. A
//! fake this process wrote itself is busy for as long as any such child lives.
//! A rename does not help: the new name points at the same file, and the
//! child's fd still writes to it. So the bytes go to a side file, a `cp` child
//! writes the file that runs, and this process never opens that file for writing.
//!
//! Also the shared [`Scratch`] guard (#544).
